# onrepeatify

wouldn't it be cool to automatically create a playlist with all your most listened songs on Spotify?

for this to happen, we will create a playlist which contains all your past and current favorites.

this means we will add all songs from 'On Repeat' and 'Repeat Rewind' to a new playlist created by you.

run the script once in a while to synchronize and add your new favorites, but don't forget about the old ones.

this is a script which can be used to copy tracks from one playlist to the other using the Spotify API through spotipy.
